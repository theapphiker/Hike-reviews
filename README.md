# Hike-reviews
Python script that allows the user to input a link to a hike on hikingupward.com, and then summarizes what hikers liked and disliked about the hike based on the comments. The script classifies the comments using a pre-trained Naive Bayes model, and then extracts the most common adjectives used to describe the hike. This project is a work in progress, and I am working to improve the model and the summary.
